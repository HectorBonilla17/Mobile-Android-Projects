Using IEX's stock API, the app will retrieve information on each stock in the user's list, ex: price & the amount that has changed today. The app allows for user-input to attempt to add a stock, which it will do so if the stock symbol is recognized the API otherwise it will inform the user that stock symbol is invalid.
